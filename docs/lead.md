# Organize an Event

## Prerequisites

* A location with WiFi and some tables
* Attendees should bring their Laptops (or Desktops and Monitor and Cables and keyboard and Mouse and â€¦ --- Well, a Laptop is easier)
* Everyone will need a working environment to write tests in. Have a look at the [resources page](/resources/).

## On the event

* Gather, decide whether your group wants to write tests for one specific extension/package/function or each attendee writes tests for whatever they feel comfortable with
* Write tests
* Commit the tests.
