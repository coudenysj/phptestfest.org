    Docker tools to easily create and run tests for the [PHP-SRC](https://github.com/php/php-src). The intent of this library is to help any PHP 
    developer to create PHPT tests for the language engine and its core extensions.
---
## How to get it?

1. You will **need** to have [Docker][docker] installed on your machine.

2. Run our installer:

````bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/herdphp/docker-phpqa/master/bin/installer.sh | bash
````

Start PHPTesting!!!

## How to use it?

### To generate new PHPT test files

The [generate-phpt][generate-phpt] tool wrapped by `docker-phpqa` is a developer tool 
[that lives inside of PHP-SRC repository][generate-phpt]. Its usage is very simple and the intent is to bootstrap PHPT
creation.

````
Usage:
phpqa generate [PHPT_DIR] -f <function_name> |-c <class_name> -m <method_name> -b|e|v [-s skipif:ini:clean:done] [-k win|notwin|64b|not64b] [-x ext]

Where:
-f function_name ................. Name of PHP function, eg cos
-c class name .....................Name of class, eg DOMDocument
-m method name ....................Name of method, eg createAttribute
-b ............................... Generate basic tests
-e ............................... Generate error tests
-v ............................... Generate variation tests
-s sections....................... Create optional sections, colon separated list
-k skipif key..................... Skipif option, only used if -s skipif is used.
-x extension.......................Skipif option, specify extension to check for
-h ............................... Print this message
````

If you want to see the help you can just use:

````bash
phpqa generate -h
````

If you want to create a *basic* PHPT test for [the `ucfirst` function][php-function-ucfirst]:

````bash
phpqa generate -f ucfirst -b
````

This will create a template PHPT file for the function ucfirst inside of
the `phpt/` directory.

If you want to override the destination directory where the files are generated
you can pass it as the first argument of the generate command:

````bash
phpqa generate /path/to/phpt/dir -f ucfirst -b
````

### To run your created tests against multiple PHP versions

1. Write a PHPT test in **any folder**;
2. Run the `phpqa` command passing as arguments the filepath (relative or full) and the PHP version to run the test (72, 71, 70, 56, 55):

````bash
# without a version the test will run against PHP 7.1 codebase
phpqa run phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt
# with a version the test will run against the specified version
phpqa run phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt 56
# if you want you can pass `all` as second argument and the test will run against all versions
phpqa run phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt all
````

## PHP versions available

PHP 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2 (Beta1) are fully available and supported;
