Getting Started
===============

----

Tools That You Will Need
------------------------

Some basic tools to get you started:

* A github account

* A fork of the TestFest repo in your github account: https://github.com/phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src

* Docker

* A text editor or a PHP IDE


----


Let's Fork It!
--------------

* Go to https://github.com/phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src and click the "Fork" button

* Go to your fork of ``phpfest-php-src`` in your github account and click the "Clone or download" button

* Copy the path provided (use HTTPS if you do not already have an SSH key associated with your github account)

* Clone the repo on your dev machine and go to that new directory

  .. code:: bash

     git clone copied-path-of-your-fork-of-phptestfest-php-src
     cd phptestfest-php-src

----

Let's Fork It! -- cont.
-----------------------

* Verify that your ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` match your github account details.

  .. code:: bash

     git config -l | grep user

----

Let's Fork It! -- cont.
-----------------------

* Set up your upstream branch to point to ``phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src`` 
  
  * This makes it easier to sync your local and github repos with the official PHP TestFest repo

  .. code:: bash

     git remote add upstream git@github.com:phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src.git
     # Or, if you do not have a github SSH key
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src.git

* Before you begin to work off of a branch of ``phpcommunity/phptestfest-php-src``, sync that branch between your three repos

  .. code:: bash

     git checkout phptestfest-2017-master
     git pull upstream phptestfest-2017-master
     git push origin phptestfest-2017-master
