PHP TestFest Contributed Presentations
======================================

Welcome to the community-contributed PHP TestFest presentations. If you have
content you'd like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request.

*NOTE: The content must be yours to contribute, and you acknowledge that any
contributions are under the terms and conditions of the* `Apache License,
Version 2.0`_.

All presentations in the ``slides/`` folder use reStructuredText_ as their
mark-up language. reStructuredText is similar to Markdown but has a variety of
other features that make it a bit more expressive. The Sphinx project has a
great `primer on how to write reStructuredText`_. It's easy to use.

We use `Hovercraft!`_ to convert this mark-up into presentable HTML. Under the
hood, Hovercraft! uses `impress.js`_ to create beautiful presentations.
Hovercraft! gives us the ability to easily accept contributions and track
changes in a version control system. It's just plain text, and we like that.

The easiest way to run and preview these presentations using Hovercraft! is
to use Docker_. From the ``slides/`` directory, run the following (replacing
``presentation-name`` with the name of the presentation you wish to preview).
This command will launch a Docker container, allowing you to preview the
presentation.

.. code:: shell

    ./present presentation-name.rst

Now, open http://localhost:9000 in your web browser and click through the
slides! In the web browser, type "h" for the help console.

That's all there is to it. Have fun!
